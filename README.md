# Comparative Study of Dermoscopic Hair Removal Methods

In this work, we present a hair removal benchmark of six state-of-the-art algorithms, each with a different approach to segment and inpaint the hair pixels. To evaluate the algorithms, 13 dermoscopic images without hair were selected from the PH2 database. Next, two different hair simulators, providing hairs with a wide range of characteristics, are applied to these images.
